# SynergyNet 2.1

A platform independent multi-touch software framework. This software relies on an externally provided vision system (such as CCV). The framework employs a number of java libraries, including JME, for the creation of networked applications which can utilise multi-touch inputs.

**This version of the framework is no longer developed or supported.**

Please see [SynergyNet 2.5](https://github.com/synergynet/synergynet2.5) or [SynergyNet 3.1](https://github.com/synergynet/synergynet3.1) for the more recent implementations of this framework.
